## Introduction

Solana is a high-performance blockchain that supports fast and low-cost transactions. At its core, Solana uses the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) for executing smart contracts. Understanding how to write BPF programs in Assembly can enhance your skills as a Solana developer. This repository provides the tools and resources you need to learn and master Solana BPF Assembly.

## Getting Started

To begin your journey with Solana BPF Assembly, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EquosTeam/Learn-Solana-BPF-Assembly.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have the required tools installed. You will need:
   - Rust programming language
   - Solana CLI
   - LLVM toolchain

3. **Build the Project**: Navigate to the project directory and run the build command.
   ```bash
   cd Learn-Solana-BPF-Assembly
   cargo build
   ```

4. **Explore the Examples**: Check out the examples in the `examples` directory to see how to write BPF programs in Assembly.

5. **Run the Programs**: Use the Solana CLI to deploy and test your programs on the Solana testnet.
