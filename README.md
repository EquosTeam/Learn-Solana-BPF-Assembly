This repository serves as a Solana BPF Assembly (sBPF) learning resource. It aims to guide developers, from beginners to experts, in writing low-level Solana programs in Assembly. We consolidate project-specific technical documentation and highlight key examples from the broader Solana development community, featuring valuable work by developers like Dean 利迪恩 (@deanmlittle) and the Firedancer team to illustrate practical sBPF programming.

**Key Features:**
- Progressive learning paths from foundational concepts to advanced topics.
- Curated references to high-quality, optimized community examples.
- Consolidated instruction set details, opcode tables, and sBPF specifics.
- In-depth technical documentation on the sBPF execution model, memory map, and register usage.
- Clear, organized navigation to help you find information quickly.

## 💻 Code Examples

Learn by doing with these practical examples:

### [No-Operation Program](./examples/sbpf-asm-noop)
A minimal Solana program in assembly by Dean 利迪恩 (@deanmlittle). Optimized to just 336 bytes, it's a great starting point.

### [Fibonacci Calculator](./examples/solana-fibonacci-asm)
Calculates Fibonacci numbers using assembly, by Dean 利迪恩 (@deanmlittle). Demonstrates computation, achieving F(93) in only 653 CUs.

### [Token Program](./examples/token.sbpf)
A complete token program implementation by Firedancer Contributors. Highly optimized, performing transfers in just 56 CUs.
